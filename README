This is an anaconda addon for configuring kdump. To use, copy the
com_redhat_kdump directory into /usr/share/anaconda/addons on your
installation media. /etc/kdump.conf will also be needed in the installation
environment to provide the default contents of /etc/kdump.conf on the
installed system.

The syntax of the addon's kickstart section is:

%addon com_redhat_kdump (--enable|--disable) --reserve-mb=("auto"|<amount>)
<contents of /etc/kdump.conf>
%end

Note that support for arguments on the %addon line was added in
anaconda-21.23. See anaconda commit 3a512e4f9e15977f0ce2d0bbe39e841b881398f3,
