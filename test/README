This is an anaconda addon for configuring kdump. To use, there are
the following two possible approachs.

1.copy the com_redhat_kdump directory into /usr/share/anaconda/addons
on your installation media.

2.use the script makeimage an upload in ./test.

makeimage will create usr/share/anaconda/addons dir under ./test and
copy com_redhat_kdump dir to it then using cpio and gzip to create a
image in ./test.

upload will upload the image makeimage created to some remote HTTP or
FTP server. You should change the server to what you can access. 

After uploading the image to a remote server, add a boot parameter like
"linux updates=http://some.website.com/path/to/updates.img" to let the
anaconda download the image from that server while installation process.

Since we modified the origin kdump addon, /etc/kdump.conf will not be
needed in the installation environment to provide the default contents
of /etc/kdump.conf on the installed system.

The syntax of the addon's kickstart section is:

%addon com_redhat_kdump (--enable|--disable) --reserve-mb=("auto"|<amount>)
<contents of /etc/kdump.conf>
%end

Note that support for arguments on the %addon line was added in
anaconda-21.23. See anaconda commit 3a512e4f9e15977f0ce2d0bbe39e841b881398f3,
